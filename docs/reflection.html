            website.<h2>MY REFLECTION</h2><p>Overall, it is hard for me to say which style of
            website creation I prefer. Both clearly have their benefits. I enjoyed WordPress for its
            themes and ease of use, but I know that using HTML and CSS styling can let me go a lot
            more in depth if I really wanted to. If I had to recommended website creation to someone
            who has never made a website and is looking for something simple and that looks nice, I
            would probably recommend WordPress. However, if they wanted to really delve deep and
            make a site that is truly their own, using HTML would be the way to go.</p>
        <p>For me, while I enjoyed Word Press, I think HTML is a better choice. It’s somewhat funny
            saying that because I think my WordPress website looks better than my HTML one, but I
            know that over time my HTML site could look just as good if not better than the
            WordPress one. The biggest challenge of HTML, in my opinion, is mastering the CSS
            styling. If it wasn’t for countless guides online figuring out how to do everything
            would be extremely difficult. Personally there aren’t many challenges with WordPress,
            but if I had to choose something it would be finding where all of the settings are, as
            the layout can be somewhat confusing.</p>
        <p>I hope to continue working on one of these in the future, or maybe even both.</p>
