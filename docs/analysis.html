        <h1>ZORDAK</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>After looking through the avaliable games I decided to play ZORDAK. ZORDAK is first and
            formost a 2D action adventure game, a more niche name for this genre would be a
            "Metroidvania." This game wears its inspiration on its sleeve, that being the Super
            Nintendo game: Super Metroid. The game's protagonist and setting are similar, the basic
            gameplay formula is similar, and even smaller details are directly lifted from Super
            Metroid.</p>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>The story of ZORDAK isn't too complex. The game has an opening cutscene that shows the
            titular planet Zordak. <figure>
            <img src="images/3.png" />
            <figcaption>The planet Zordak.</figcaption>
        </figure> The main character (who's name I do not know, I don't think it is stated within
        the demo) is sent to discover an anomaly on the planet. She appears to be cryogenically
        frozen or put in some sort of statis. It is stated that the mission should take roughly 3
        years, but something goes wrong and the game cuts to 200 years later where our protagonist
        wakes up. From there the player is put through a brief tutorial before that's topped off by
        an escape sequence. <figure>
            <img src="images/9.png" />
            <figcaption>Escape sequence.</figcaption>
        </figure> After that the player is then set off to explore the planet. That's really all the
        story the demo gives at the moment, which I don't think is too big of an issue because I
        assume more will be added in the full game. <figure>
            <img src="images/7.png" />

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>ZORDAK's protagonist clearly takes inspiration from Samus Aran from Metroid. You play as
            a blonde female who eventually aquires a form of power suit that can shoot beams. <figure>
            <img src="images/20.png" />
            <figcaption>The Geo Suit firing energy beams.</figcaption>
        </figure> The general gameplay loop also follows that of a Metroid game. You platform around
        different parts of the planet in search of various upgrades that you use to clear your path
        forward. There are various enemies you face along the way, and this is where I believe the
        game is most derivative of Super Metroid. The large majority of the enemies faced in ZORDAK
        are very similar to ones from Metroid. Flying enemies that drop projectiles downwards,
        crawling enemies that cling to surfaces and deal damage on contact, and enemies that hang
        from the ceiling to swoop down on the player. <figure>
            <img src="images/22.png" />
            <figcaption>This enemy shares many similarities with "Geemers" from the Metroid
                series.</figcaption>
        </figure> I think the game would benefit from some more creative enemy types, I personally
        enjoyed the strange eletric plant that emit sparks in a large radius that blocked your path,
        they seemed quite unique. <figure>
            <img src="images/31.png" />
            <figcaption>Electric plant enemy blocking the way forward.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The most important part of ZORDAK is exploration and puzzle solving. The most common
            puzzle would be breakable tiles that cause a chain reaction that open a path forward. My
            favorite puzzle from the demo involved finding a code hidden behind a crack in the wall
            (the code also seemed to be randomly generated, as in a second playthrough the code had
            changed). <figure>
            <img src="images/17.png" />
            <figcaption>Randomly generated code hidden behind a wall.</figcaption>
        </figure> Once the player has the code they enter it into a keypad and use a battery found
        in a nearby area to aquire the game's power suit. <figure>
            <img src="images/18.png" />
            <figcaption>Code entry pad.</figcaption>
        </figure> Overall the exploration was fun but won't be for everyone, I feel that if this was
        someone's first Metroidvania they could easily get lost and end up quitting. <p>The last bit
            of gameplay I want to mention is the demo's final boss fight. Throughout the demo you
            will spot strange blobs hanging from the ceiling and the walls. The deeper you venture
            the more goo you'll see. <figure>
            <img src="images/33.png" />
            <figcaption>Strange purple goo.</figcaption>
        </figure> Eventually it leads to a room where a large liquid creature named "Slither"
        appears. <figure>
            <img src="images/35.png" />
            <figcaption>Slither, the demo's final battle.</figcaption>
        </figure> For a first fight it's pretty simple and effective. The boss has 3 large eyeballs
        that act as weakpoint and can shoot projectiles at the player. These eyeballs can be
        destroyed to make the fight simpler. The boss will jump in and out of pits of goo to attack
        the player and every once and a while the boss will hide and a swarm of bugs will fly from
        the ceiling that the player can kill for energy to restore health. For a first boss I think
        the theme was unique and the way you fight it was fun and engaging. The only complaint I
        really heve is that the boss healthbar is listed as a number and a bar, when I think just
        having a basic healthbar would make the fight simpler and clearn the UI a bit.
            <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>The game's visuals are very well done. The game uses modern graphical techniques combined
            with 2D sprite art. The lighting especially is very well done. The little detials really
            sell the environment, like the grass blowing in the wind and the sparks flying from
            broken technology. The reflections in the water and other liquids was also very
            impressive. <figure>
            <img src="images/15.png" />
            <figcaption>Reflections seen in a pool of acid.</figcaption>
        </figure> The most comparable graphical style I can compare this game to is another
        metroidvania named Carrion. <p>I don't have much to say about the game's music. Nothing was
            too memorable, but I think that works in the game's favor. You're all alone on this
            foreign world and the subtle music helps elevate that feeling of isolation. I personally
            enjoyed the music for the overgrown laboratory area.</p>
        <p>Lastly I think the game's UI was well done. It takes clear inspiration from Super Metroid
            with the energy counter and upgrades. <figure>
            <img src="images/30.png" />
            <figcaption>The UI.</figcaption>
        </figure> The minimap was a nice touch to help navigate as well. <figure>
            <img src="images/11.png" />
            <figcaption>The full map.</figcaption>
        </figure> A small detail I enjoyed was that the UI was hidden until the protagonist put on a
        helmet which activated the HUD. <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Overall I enjoyed ZORDAK. I think the basic gameplay loop is very well done, if a bit
            derivative. That's probably my biggest issue with the game so far. Everything it does is
            very similar to Super Metroid. It's clear that's what the developer wanted, but I hope
            that the final product has a few more unique mechanics or upgrades to set itself apart.
            I think the boss fight was very enjoyable so I hope to see more interesting fights in
            the full game. I have very little negative things to say about the game's visuals
            beacuse they are just that well done. I look forward to seeing more of this game in the
            future.</p>
