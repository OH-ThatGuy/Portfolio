        <h1>Game Analysis</h1>
        <p>Currently I have 46 screenshots that I still need to trim down and/or upload to this
            page, they will be added at a later date, for now I have sent a screenshot of the
            screenshot folder to Canvas.</p>
        <h1>ZORDAK</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>After looking through the avaliable games I decided to play ZORDAK. ZORDAK is first and
            formost a 2D action adventure game, a more niche name for this genre would be a
            "Metroidvania." This game wears its inspiration on its sleeve, that being the Super
            Nintendo game: Super Metroid. The game's protagonist and setting are similar, the basic
            gameplay formula is similar, and even smaller details are directly lifted from Super
            Metroid.</p>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>The story of ZORDAK isn't too complex. The game has an opening cutscene that shows the
            titular planet Zordak. The main character (who's name I do not know, I don't think it is
            stated within the demo) is sent to discover an anomaly on the planet. She appears to be
            cryogenically frozen or put in some sort of statis. It is stated that the mission should
            take roughly 3 years, but something goes wrong and the game cuts to 200 years later
            where our protagonist wakes up. From there the player is put through a brief tutorial
            before setting off to explore the planet. That's really all the story the demo gives at
            the moment, which I don't think is too big of an issue because I assume more will be
            added in the full game. 
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>ZORDAK's protagonist clearly takes inspiration from Samus Aran from Metroid. You play as
            a blonde female who eventually aquires a form of power suit that can shoot beams. The
            general gameplay loop also follows that of a Metroid game. You platform around different
            parts of the planet in search of various upgrades that you use to clear your path
            forward. There are various enemies you face along the way, and this is where I believe
            the game is most derivative of Super Metroid. The large majority of the enemies faced in
            ZORDAK are very similar to ones from Metroid. Flying enemies that drop projectiles
            downwards, crawling enemies that cling to surfaces and deal damage on contact, and
            enemies that hang from the ceiling to swoop down on the player. I think the game would
            benefit from some more creative enemy types, I personally enjoyed the strange eletric
            plant that emit sparks in a large radius that blocked your path, they seemed quite
            unique.</p>
        <p>The most important part of ZORDAK is exploration and puzzle solving. The most common
            puzzle would be breakable tiles that cause a chain reaction that open a path forward. My
            favorite puzzle from the demo involved finding a code hidden behind a crack in the wall
            (the code also seemed to be randomly generated, as in a second playthrough the code had
            changed). Once the player has the code they enter it into a keypad and use a battery
            found in a nearby area to aquire the game's power suit. Overall the exploration was fun
            but won't be for everyone, I feel that if this was someone's first Metroidvania they
            could easily get lost and end up quitting. </p>
        <p>The last bit of gameplay I want to mention is the demo's final boss fight. Throughout the
            demo you will spot strange blobs hanging from the ceiling and the walls. The deeper you
            venture the more goo you'll see. Eventually it leads to a room where a large liquid
            creature named "Slither" appears. For a first fight it's pretty simple and effective.
            The boss has 3 large eyeballs that act as weakpoint and can shoot projectiles at the
            player. These eyeballs can be destroyed to make the fight simpler. The boss will jump in
            and out of pits of goo to attack the player and every once and a while the boss will
            hide and a swarm of bugs will fly from the ceiling that the player can kill for energy
            to restore health. For a first boss I think the theme was unique and the way you fight
            it was fun and engaging. The only complaint I really heve is that the boss healthbar is
            listed as a number and a bar, when I think just having a basic healthbar would make the
            fight simpler and clearn the UI a bit.</p>
        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>The game's visuals are very well done. The game uses modern graphical techniques combined
            with 2D sprite art. The lighting especially is very well done. The little detials really
            sell the environment, like the grass blowing in the wind and the sparks flying from
            broken technology. The reflections in the water and other liquids was also very
            impressive. The most comparable graphical style I can compare this game to is
            Carrion.</p>
        <p>I don't have much to say about the game's music. Nothing was too memorable, but I think
            that works in the game's favor. You're all alone on this foreign world and the subtle
            music helps elevate that feeling of isolation. I personally enjoyed the music for the
            overgrown laboratory area.</p>
        <p>Lastly I think the game's UI was well done. It takes clear inspiration from Super Metroid
            with the energy counter and upgrades. The minimap was a nice touch to help navigate as
            well. A small detail I enjoyed was that the UI was hidden until the protagonist put on a
            helmet which activated the HUD.</p>
        <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Overall I enjoyed ZORDAK. I think the basic gameplay loop is very well done, if a bit
            derivative. That's probably my biggest issue with the game so far. Everything it does is
            very similar to Super Metroid. It's clear that's what the developer wanted, but I hope
            that the final product has a few more unique mechanics or upgrades to set itself apart.
            I think the boss fight was very enjoyable so I hope to see more interesting fights in
            the full game. I have very little negative things to say about the game's visuals
            beacuse they are just that well done. I look forward to seeing more of this game in the
            future.</p>
