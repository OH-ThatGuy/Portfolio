        <h1>WELCOME</h1>
        <p>This is my new and improved web page. If I am being honest with you dear reader, I have
            no clue what to put here at the moment. However, maybe the lack of any meaningful
            substance <strong>IS</strong> my meaningful substance! In the future maybe I could
            update this site with a few more features that would actually interest you, but for now
            this is what I have to give, and I hope you enjoy it.</p>
        <p>Moving on...</p>
