        <h1>HTML THING</h1>
        <p>I changed the page color to white because it helped cover the jpg crust on my image.
            Anyways, the text that is about to appear will be bolded. Watch, this is gonna be crazy.
                <strong>I told you. Isn't this crazy, the text is like, darker than normal.</strong>

                because I couldn't think of anything more clever</a>.</p>
