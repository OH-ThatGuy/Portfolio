        <h1>Text Analysis</h1>
        <p> I decied to compare two different 19th century texts. The first text I analyzed was Bram
            Stoker's <i>Dracula</i>. I compared it to Edgar Allan Poe's <i>The Cask of
                Amontillado</i> I compared the two because not only were they both written in the
            19th century, but they are also both horror stories. I also think comparing the much
            longer <i>Dracula</i> to the shorter <i>The Cask of Amontillado</i> could reveal some
            interesting insights on the differences between short and long stories. </p>
        <h2>Dracula</h2>
        <p>Before I compare the two texts, I would like to start by examining each individually.</p>
